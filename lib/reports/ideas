**San: Allow all classes that get regular meditate to be able to learn advanced meditate epic skill
**Saif: mana eq is a bitch
**Dywer: scoundrel 51 trip instead of 52 as its really the only reason to play one and only diffrence and other rogue specs get there new skill at 51
**Rakaxs: longbow should be a belt attachable!
**Nang: make it so that you can cast titan if you have images up now that images are not orderable pets.
**Nang: change shadow monster spell so it summons a single low hp follower instead of being a fairly worthless damage spell that doesn't damage anything (since images can't be pets anymore)
**Aktosh: might consider making artifacts easier to feed if threyre not going to be as good
**Aktosh: death to undead is very weak seeming in comparison to my destroy undead spell for higher slot
**Xziz: Improvements should be made upon Cavalier's who fight while mounted on Centaurs...also there should be no chance to get bucked by the centaur.
**Kra: You should allow people to buy feed on their arti's since evils don't always show their faces...
**Aktosh: make undeath to death work on golems
**Feffen: rangers and reavers need an epic skill that makes their attacks unblockable at least for a period of time, dazzle doesnt work on dragon/demons and in pvp at least reavers can not tank anything that is required for dazzle to work
**Avenia: being able to lance charge reclining people is kinda stupid
**Avenia: staff of woodlands should turn u into race treant
**Choron: spells like wither entangle and slow are way to powerful in the way they make you walk slower on maps and such, its enough to make them let you fight bad.
**Jotr: have some way to get out of battle x, maybe with a pause like disguise?
**Fazli: Sanguine and blight should be 1d12.  Shard from ceo is 1d12. silencer from eth is 1d11. vanquishing is 1d12. etc.  i could go on.  2d9 dice is horrible for a level 55 zone.  Thanks
**Nacir: bark
**Rutger: sleeves
**Ralunor: 26912
**Jotr: there should be some code or zones where even numbered fights only are allowed
**Jotr: the hitroll changes are especially harsh for tanks.. i have to wear defensive gear to be a tank, but always end up sacrificing hit/dam.  with lowered hitroll i miss so terribly it's not worth even trying to hit most players
**Avenia: readd channel
**Dywer: make hoard follow regardless if i am invisible
**Dywer: please make wh level restricted no one over level 45 after level 45 you have enouhg conectpt of the game to stay alive just a not all wh is doing right now is protecting hi level ascension look at the who list a small 10% part of who list is newbies.this is just my imo but shared with many we cannot get a fight otehr then to stand outside wh could always amek tehre gh in ws maybe add a few guards make it more like where our guild hall is in khildarek i dont want them being chesed or easily gotten too but as it is now it is impossible to raid them in wh
**Rakaxs: someone had a good idea.  take skills from swashbuckler and disperse it amongst remaining rogue classes
**Rakaxs: assassins need riposte as well.  i mean we are fucking killers not pansies.  u hit us we are going to strike back!
**Rakaxs: apply poison needs to be fixed.  currently useless skill for assassins
**Rakaxs: stabbers from neg need dice upgrade to be consistent with other dagggers out there
**Tziik: such as Mental Penetration could equal Spell Penetration and Quicken Mind could equal Chant Mastery
**Tziik: would be cool with more epic skills for psis - simialr to mage ones
**Tziik: would be nice if you added some more Epic Skills to psis, similar to the ones mages got
**Saif: do spell penetration for psionicists
**Aktosh: lower imps again theyre retardedly hard
**Avenia: the spell slowness lasts way too long. should be like maybe 30 second spell. that's still a huge amount of time in a raid
**Choron: would be nice if mercs got pick lock skill and capped really low but thus letting mercs being able to use it in zones.
**Izeren: why can'tthe grouplist display (number ofgroupmembers inroom / totalgroupmembers )  instead of (total groupmembers / 99 )
**Choron: it would be nice with a skill who would let ppl wear a shield in combat, like remove a sword when dualling and wear a shield.
**Choron: would be great if you could cancel auctions
**Tyrone: tw
**Nazz: remove orogs or upgrade them
**Feffen: give reavers an epic skill that makes it harder to block/dodge/parry/riposte their attacks
**Nostri: Goods were originally designed to be for inexperienced players. However the number of truly noob players is very few, with about 80% of the goodies are experienced players (former evils) and with our numbers almost always being about 1/2 or less then their players, isn't a balancing needed?
**Rakaxs: pwipe time. take a vote. its past due for wipeage.
**Raq: Need help file for Suppress Sound and Expedited Retreat.
**Sprek: Could you please take a look at Kra's locker.  I can clearly see what he raids in and what he plays in are two differnt sets. I have seen him running around hometown completely STACKED with 850 hps unvited, Just annoying to see a difference in playing integrity, 
**Choron: would be awesome with a mining and sailing epic skill.
**Astra: allow Half-Elves to be Thief...and Mercenary....
**Astra: allow Half-Elves to be Scoundrel's
**Astra: give Scoundrel circle and track ability
**Denai: make it so can give titan orders please so when they start nuking my group instead of target cuz area i can make then feign or flee so they poof
**Denai: make titans perm fly plz so don't get swept away in current
**Alurissi: epic random mobs should carry more cash
**Gukkz: how about laying out exp bassed on kill instead of tank exp, you wont find people botting without killing then, efficient and works
**Dywer: make a timer present for drinks
**Zel: make it so you can suicide when your negative hitpoints so don't have to waiting FORVER to die
**Avenia: this crap where dracos leave their master to go assist some other random fucking mohb is just idiotic
**Nostri: Make misfire MORE dangerous for the side doing it, currently a 16+ group and/or goods/evils have 16 people in same area isn't causing the misfiring side much of a problem.
**Syrak: another idea for a damage over time air magus spell name would be whirlwind vortex
**Babo: helm
**Boko: remove song of charming, sirens song from bards and give them a new lvl 56 song that is traditional with the rest of the game... typically an offense. something associated with sound waves, maybe a combo between stunning due to sound impact, knockdown, but nothing that would really cause a lot of damage, instead, disruption. however, if defensive song would be maybe help scatter magical spells done to group members. these are radical and prop not in sync with game, but maybe a better idea can spawn from this
**Xanan: increase the value of sold items (ore, cargo) so more people can have luxury rather than just us who are on all day
**Yzai: new locker charge is crazy, i gotta pay 600 p to enter my locker everytime, thats outrageous just because some idiot lost the zone loot
**Bokn: If someone's kick crashes into your chest... doesn't it seem odd that your head item would take damage?
**Avenia: i think the effect of psychic crush may last a little too fucking long
**Znar: encrusting a wpn should make it magical along with what ever other stone properties are given
**Firot: You guys REALLY need to shrink the maps, you need to spend far too much time scouting to find nothing most of the time.
**Choron: Please make Krindors for mercs a whip that has a drainproc.
**Syrak: All other conjurer specs have damage over time offensive capabilities except Air Magus, given the recent change to cyclone and the fact it only does 30-40 damage I think a new spell could be implemented for Air Magus that would be similar to magma burst/acidimmolate/dread wave, placed in tenth circle like Earth Magus. Gale blast, tornado storm are some idea's for names for the spell. Perhaps the message could read when in effect for pulse damage, The gale force winds blow piercing shrapnel into your body!
**Khazan: Fix battlesenses so it procs dodge again perhaps? Been months since ya'll said you would look at it, smirk, the skill used to be one of the reasons dreadlords could stand up in a hitter fight..
**Denai: fix titan so it stays on target it's originally casted on meaning if it's stunned or anything it will go back on original target as draz area proc and my titan hammers him instead of my frickin target...says in help file titan lives until target is dead or leaves room and he attacked wrong target
**Denai: torhann has port for cargo so it should have a bank not to mention it has all the makings of a town
**Denai: and shadow monster is a joke...make it more level dependant please like magic missile
**Denai: make it so can use titan while using reflections please....bad enough we got crap for nukes
**Avenia: need a grimace social
**Avenia: outta be able to range a whip with a different message
**Choron: allow more epic skills to be used by different classes. simply let them cap lower but be optional if the class has the particular skill that is also an epic skill. example, i have riposte in my skillist, id like to be able to buy the epic skill improved riposte, just let it be a little less powerful than for a class that caps his riposteskill at 100...
**Avenia: should mine faster when yer hasted
**Avenia: shouting guards from wh should be flagged stay_zone
**Dravin: evils should get monk class since goods can be zerkers
**Dywer: put one of those makeshift dokcs on souther ec like near sameriz or qq
**Feffen: let the bad eq poof more then the good in pvp  its barely rewarding to kill people sometimes cuz all sneak/stone/hide/invis poof
**Majk: if your going to charge us for lockers, maybe have the locker tell you how many items are in it
**Sprek: please give halfing something like summon wolf for a mount.  Moves are KILLING me.
**Rila: raise the max amount of items before premium to 400 or 350 it is more sensible i think!
**Choron: i wish for the second worst skill in game (headbutt) to be useful... i wish for the worst skill in game (double headbutt) to be useful, its my level 56 deathskill and it does nothing good... please
**Gribs: why can rangers do either 1h slashing or 1h piercing yet i cant wield the dagger arties!
**Jagie: badge
**Jagie: badge
**Jagie: stud
**Jagie: gloves
**Jag: pickax
**Ashwee: when you hit recall it also recalls god tells.
**Helty: how about summon familiar imps don't cast while running the map?
**Syrak: Something that has always bothered me, why don't summoned elementals be within 5 levels of the summoner? Necros get pets that are similar in level, why can't conjies. Nothing is more time wasting than trying to get an elemental that isn't wearing a skirt.
**Morta: milenius
**San: Give meteorswarm to cosmomancer 10th circle
**Clorins: Think it is time for necro's to get wall of bones, about the same level conj's get wall of stone. necro's are just to much frag bait to not have any defense
**Miko: for ship weapons..dont hide weapons not available for people with ships too small..but list the weapons with required hull size 
**Fazli: the aggros in hometowns NEEDS to be removed.
**Dramn: beholder dispel drops berserk and other zerker abilities. non magical abilities.
**Dramn: fix beholders. Disin player eq is retarded when some mobs are balanced with battle x and other things that make the fight burn through more eq than you can get from the zone to start with (neg)
**Buv: beholders poofing eq is really annoying --- no mobs should have the ability to destroy player eq -- thats just really annoying.
**Dywer: please look at epic con put 12k plat into something that gives like 10 hps is so far from worht it comaprd to what the other stat epics do
**Fazli: to even race balances. drows should be guardians.  if you add up all guardians that goods have vs evils.  It would be a nice balance and make drows more...useable...if thats possible
**Dravin: why is woodlands staff only for druids.  how are evils supposed to feed it
**Buv: staff of woodlands should be useable by both sides.
**Aktosh: make vecnas druid only arti usable by some evil class
**Aktosh: remove apoc and judgement and lets see how things are, theyll be awesome classes still
**Aktosh: like change the damage to chain lightning to counter apocs cloud
**Aktosh: simply make judgement area damage the same as apoc cloud damage
**Zarg: some sort of spell other than dispel to heal slowness?
**Rila: make weightless containers have a visible no_weight flag when identified
**Fazli: stabbers for negative dice need to be upped as that zone is epically hard compared to say...ethereal or...vanquishing or...ceothia
**Sokatoa: amulet
**Lactsyr: rather than straight having chars on both sides to switch eq.. that should be limited to sharing lockers.. and then the 1hr rule should still apply.
**Jotr: summon mount makes your current mount come to you, or summons a new one if you dont have one
**Vorador: a 56 necro nuke or the use of 2 greater dracolichs
**Frenbaar: you shouldnt be assigned tasks that are already done
**Lactsyr: the save for dispel magic and the stat to make it more effective should be listed in the help file.
**Lactsyr: call lightning should be an area spell and just strike non-groupmembers randomly..
**Anizius: stones
**Zas: Please term zloin he is a repeat offender of not dressed enough or not at all.  I know he has good gear he has killed plenty of evils with kra.
**Zynu: umm add more incentive to deal with this auto berzerking like better charge
**Zynu: should build in a group recount for damage/healing done like the addons you can get for World of warcraft to see such
**Hovva: i have 44 hitroll and mobs dodge half my attacks im level 54 this is pathetic
**Frenbaar: applied poisons should have differnet effects.. the poison you get from the end of ceothia shouldnt be the same as the poison you buy in the store for 1 plat
**Zloin: Make it so you get the frag ratio based on how many people are in your group, so if someone waits outside a fight picking off fleers for full frags they don't exploit the code, and to encourage people to raid in smaller groups.
**Maworm: make spec possibility for drow cleric, healer
**Fazli: drow and gith need to be healera since githz and grey are
**Dywer: drow healer since grey is
**Rakaxs: b'ardingol proc on the receiving in says "an orc brings town the twin"   "town"  not "down"
**Lactcon: sandals
**Milenius: mob trophy of epic mobs, similiar to epic trophy would be cool addition :)
**Aktosh: remove the lag at the end of summon ghasts
**Alurissi: make epic randoms worth 1k plats, 58 for all that trouble is kinda a rip off, specially when the eq you get has HIGH chance of being crap
**Gribs: longsword
**Rakaxs: icecrown should be all hitter type classes. even assassin's/ thieves
**Choron: make battlelogs show like 10 seconds after killblow on ppl so its possible to see who loots.
**Zas: delevel Kra and zloin for raiding in crap gear when they obviosly have killed people with better.
**Rakaxs: i think duergars have had enough time to deal with the cavern snakes...
**Kor: Please give ogres back arm/legs - close to impossible to dress up ogres, with the horrible saves - I wear so much saves eq most any hitter char got higher dmgroll than me
**Kag: bearstrength should be max str!
**Kesk: give necros the abiltiy to kill/scan hidden targets again , it was so rudely taken away.
**Frenbaar: all det_disguise/illus flags should be removed from game ASAP
**Aktosh: make mace of mentality float
**Aktosh: up necromancer skill cap on 1h blud to 60-75
**Lactsyr: Maps should show evil P for goods, good P for evils, then group Ps, then same-side Ps, then Ds, then Ms at the end.  It's not like we can't see both an Orc and a rabbit in the same square at the same time, but who do you think is more prominent/important/eyecatching?  Don't be a rabbit lover.
**Aktosh: make doors at kuo priestess open from inside without key due to very fast repop time
**Lactcon: earring
**Rakaxs: i'm failing a ton of stabs compared to frenbar a lower level then me. i'm also stabbing for the same as him. and stinger is supposed to enhance the stabs. draz was aware and he landed like 7/8.  i have 125 dex. something isnt right
**Kag: please add shapechage to beastmaster...only makes sense...druid and shaman!
**Nostra: stone/ib/etc you have some affect on blocking backstab.  If you stab a brickwall you aren't going to crit hit it on 4 successive hits
**Frenbaar: there should be a command to scuttle your own ship
**Rila: earring
**Lodik: we really must get summon to work on those with !summon gear, if they are grouped or consented
**Rhalid: make 'blink' castable in a direction.. so you're in combat you cast 'blink' e and (assuming its a valid direction) it magically blinks you one room over... (maybe work through doors?)
**Xanan: should upgrade dragonlord pmail to have globe and spheres again since it cannot be used with other artis
**Dramn: aravne should not repop with people inside it.
**Frenbaar: should re-add pale misty gloves artifact to game
**Granat: wall
**Granat: wall
**Lactcon: gold
**Argg: make the huge su... HUGE?!  come on....
**Kag: please add shapechage to beastmasters. it makes sense and no one is playing one.
**Duaq: you have to reduce zone hardness. 75% of zones need to be 5 man groups...and not 5 man deathstacked groups.  This will allow the new players to learn zones on their own not following a leader who just goes about business not explaining shit.  This will create more eq. and newer players will be able to death stack them selves and not just the old timers.   This will then create a match coming down to skill and not based on eq.  It will bring new players into the game.  This is my first wipe in 7+ years and i cant lead 90% of the zones...and ive been playing pretty often.  WOW did the same with zones. noone could form 40 man gr
**Frenbaar: should give minesite as part of forge epic skill once you master it to make it worthwhile
**Frenbaar: should make rare poisons, like the ones from ceothia, do something decent, rather then the same as store bought poison (8-9 damage per tick) .. perhaps increased damage, or some effect like sleep or para or slow 
**Ator: add distance allowed to scan wither ship is evil or good increased
**Frenbaar: the "smelt" epic skill is worthless, it should be rolled into the "forge" epic skill, and the "forge" eq should be upgraded
**Nostrom: Goods get all these WH quests, Evils need comparable quests.
**Drazu: make it so can sort eq through keyword-- i.e.-  eq sort keyword sinz --- all items with word sinz get sorted like all items crafted by Sinz for example
**Kag: please add shapechage to the beastmaster multi...i think i will be the only one playing one..
**Lactsyr: There should be a help file for Storm Magi: Ethermancer/Sorcerer.
**Nang: Make fishing notch faster or make it actually work more often at lower levels.  Please
**Duaq: 222 needs to be reduced slightly.   auto mob creation needs to be removed.  4+ hours already epic wipe.
**Rila: make a log for your locker for what items are removed/added
**Rila: veil
**Jagan: talons
**Lodik: it should show if a room is a heal room. basically room flags when we type terrain
**Lodik: does blind give a failed message when tested on anti-paladins?
**Alurissi: MORE RANDOM MOBS PER BOOT! AND HAVE MORE LOAD WHEN A CONTINENT IS RUNNING LOW ON THEM!
**Strom: these upgrades to Devil and Demon mobs being 90% shrug is just silly
**Avenia: blindness should prevent beholder poroc
**Avenia: new draco code where they walk in for no reason when you're not fighting their owner is really quite stupid fyi
**Kag: there are NO beastmaster players. I am making one and wondered if you would add something to the class....since they are beastmasters will you give them innate shiftchange into an animal?
**Graven: give avenger 2h bludgeon like dreadlord?
**Faiz: pwipe
**Celestra: give Centaurs the trample skills
**Torq: we really could use the right to ask 'who' while engaged
**Falshede: how about allowing mages to wear random eq named robes?
**Axati: could you maybe considering toneing down draco agro upon raise?  2 times in a row died onec but the lag keeps me from fleeing so it normally means death. Real pain to cr on other conts.
**Avenia: for next wipe remove all race/class restrictions. let anything be anything!
**Avenia: hellish imps need to be revised
**Rakaxs: sneak doesnt seem to be working right
**Nacir: scale
**Chygra: badge
**Tognut: Ogres are Size huge and can wield 2x 2-handed weapons, if a troll/barb/etc is huge or giant - let them do the same
**Tognut: Worms in CWORMS are kicking because they are type animal.  Worms don't have legs, can this be fixed
**Odom: necklace
**Avenia: epic saves!
**Gribs: we lose alot of equipment already to pvp death no reason to get it poofed just from zoning
**Gribs: reset cargo prices .. even if its only for the regular cargo
**Dywer: add feed if allready full as i frag alot yet if i go thru a spell
**Werd: rangers get unarmed combat
**Nostra: mana-reg hit-reg move-reg are not sort-able in equip sort
**Daqsta: disable look contacts on docked ships
**Gou: mace named faith should be clericable
**Avenia: ogre sorcs
**Avenia: goblin rogues
**Avenia: halfling rangers
**Avenia: githzerai paladins
**Aktosh: allow deputys to title selves
**Aktosh: limit number of demotes/kicks in a time period to prevent *cough* overreactions
**Jotr: a message about when you can shift/rent after you have been in pvp
**Kroth: you need to make golems aggro opposite racewar characters bottem line...or make evil hometowns safer...something anything...evils just massed in a zone...we have a group sitting on their golem ranging 1 north fragging dead people as they log in with 1 hp...its so wrong.  Of course 5+ of those were blood tasked.  Go figure.  And entire guild gets blood task and enemies wonder why they get gang banged
**Lactsyr: fire form should be like regen or at least stop damage from fire plane zones.
**Rej: duergar
**Kesk: with 100 infuse magical device(epic skill) you should be able to infuse a device more than once. without getting the message This device is too worn out to be infused.
**Lactsyr: Earning an epic point for being engaged to other side pvp (or nuking/healing during) for a long time.. long battles are epic. :)
**Ishatar: give Scoundrel's track at level 46 
**Sashin: make revenant crown arti where you can say for a race change, would be hella fun, and put back in death knight for goodies and evils with a warrior class unique
**Lactsyr: It would be nice to get a list of the stuff you currently have on auction.
**Lactsyr: When an item is sold at auction, it would be cool to see who had the winnning bid (i.e. A voice says in your mind, '<item> was sold for <#> platinum by <char>, and the money is available for pickup.' instead of just A voice says in your mind, '<item> was sold for <#> platinum, and the money is available for pickup.').
**Aycer: Reduce Demon's Shrug percentage. Refer to AD&D books if necessary to decern an appriorate level of MR.
**Kroth: fix the frag list. its not updating at all.
**Hova: headbutt and bearhug should vamp you if you have vamp touch, after all kick does doesnt it
**Ator: add dex pool to baha since brass has 2.
**Avenia: add a tag in your prompt that says paralysed
**Avenia: with 12k epics u should be able to double spec!
**Gukkz: battle noise sounds, that you hear 3-4 rooms away
**Gukkz: a "sanctuary" type spell, that eats 10% of damage dealt, for spellup not just "paladin self"
**Nigma: Why do Merc's have switch opponets as a 51 Skill???
**Aktosh: make the items in sevenoaks not cursed so zone can be done without requiring cleric
**Dywer: make areas only sho won continent you are on
**Reet: please update the help specs on ethermancer specs, I've heard they are off by quite a bit
**Drazu: on negative. when pockets explode...Shouldnt a undead aka phantom who normally absorbs negative energy absorb the explosion.  Just a thought.
**Sashin: apparantly, food and water is outlawed on duris, then why do you prefer plants and food growing in other muds, just not in this area? Makes me think you dont get the point, theres abundance of foods, and yet they all do the same, make grades of food, instead of imperialist growing of controlled substances that are really abundant
**Vorador: put a dockmaster on uc to summon boats from
**Drazu: monks need a 56 skill
**Aktosh: make silent spell more practical in different
