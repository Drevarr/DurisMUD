        they can contain. So you won't be able to put 5 platemail in a 
        backpack anymore. If you find out that a container cannot contain
        anything petition a God to report the problem. Remember that some
        object won't fit in container not because the container if full
        but because the object is too big to fit in. 

&+RNews for 3/29/98
      - 'arieks shattering iceball' now does a bit more damage.  Enjoy.

        low circle.  When cast, it kills everyone.  Have fun experimenting.

&+RNews for 3/23/98
      - Coin objects now have the same weight as carried coins do. They also
	have a size. (A small pile is size small). This means, coins in your
	bags may suddenly be to heavy to carry, and perhaps not even fit at
	all. In case you've forgotten, banks no longer steal...

      - Slight bit of lag has been added to corpse looters. Not bad enough

	mountain without various things. As well, moving from a mountain to
	a non-hill will cause you to fall. More will be expanded upon this,
	and one day it will begin to make sense to you. This is NOT intended
	to make the maps more difficult, trust me.

      - Castle Du'Maathe Chainmail, Ringmail, and Platemail will 
	no-longer be mage-wearable.  If you see other mage-wearable
	items similar to this I suggest you tell us.
      - On second thought, Sunray rocks, lets move it to 7th circle.

      - Equipment repairs now save properly. As a side effect, the

        damaged.

        can handle it.
      - Goodies Rejoice! Evils Whine!  There are no longer 'friendly'
        mobs for the evils to hang out with.  Yes, that means that 
        The Lizardmen think you are out to take over their territory
        and won't let you hang out in their nice, dark caves unmolested.

&+RNews for 3/11/98

    	than standard humanoids, thus are unaffected by certain spells.

&+RNews for 3/4/98
