Player Guilds
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

   This document is designed to answer any questions regarding the creation
of player guilds on Duris. Under the new guild system players are 
responsible for the organization of their own guilds. Although guilds may 
worship whatever god (although they don't have to worship any) they choose,
the gods themselves will not be responsible or serve any function in the 
running of a guild. Guilds will also be allowed to build guildhall's in 
Duris, although again this is not required to form a guild.

How To Begin A Guild
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

a) The requirements for forming a guild are as follows :
    - All guild members must be at least 25th level or above. The level 
      requirement is simply to ensure that the people in the guild are
      familiar with Duris and how it's run.
    - Guilds must also keep a member count of at least 5 members, they are
      also limited to a maximum of 25 members in the guild at a time.

b) What this allows -
   
Once this happens the guild will be created and the person forming the guild
will be flagged as a guild 'leader'. This will allow him/her to recruit
members into the guild and promote/demote them accordingly. This is done
completely without god interference and controlled by the code. Any new
members will be automaticly be flagged and titled as a member of the guild.
This also will create a guild bank account which is accessible by certain
members of the guild (see below).

  Once a guild has been started and approved by duris, the guild members
of that guild must run their own activities. How many people there are of a
certain guild rank is entirely up to the players. The gods themselves will
have no interference with the running of the guild themselves. Any new 
members, once enrolled will automaticly be titled as a member of that guild.

Guild Structure
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Guilds have specific ranks within them which give their members to
ability do different things depending on their rank. How this works is as
follows :

Leader -  
  A leader can change the names of all the ranks (this allows an guild of
sorcerers to name the leader as "ArchMage" rather than "Leader". These 
titles must be realistic in a fantasy world, leaders are ultimately 
responsible to the gods so if a title of "Mickey Mouse" is given the leader
will be the one answering for it. A leader also has the ability to flag a 
player as an enemy to the guild (leaders are the only ones that can remove
this flag as well). The leader can also add on an 'on parole' flag to
members.

Deputy -  
  A deputy (or higher) can delete, promote and demote members and also has
access to withdraw money from the guild's bank account.

Officer - 
  An officer (or higher) has the right to fine lower members (dealing out 
punishments etc).

Senior member - 
  A senior member (or higher) has the right to enroll new members.

Normal member
  A Normal member just has general abilities, access to any guildhalls that
might be available etc. They can also see what other guild members are
online.

Enemy - 
  The guild leader has the ability to flag a member as a guild enemy as 
well. This will cause the guild npc's (if any) to attack the player on 
sight and is used for betrayal etc.

Challenging Positions 
  Challenging positions is a togglable option that must be decided on when
a guild is formed. By allowing this a lower ranked player in a guild has
the ability to challenge a higher one for his position. The one with the 
higher experience has a percentage chance of winning this contest and 
assuming the higher rank in the guild.  Challenging someone however will 
cause loss of both exp to the loser and a loss of alignment for the 
challenger so be warned. Whether this is encouraged or a cause for 
punishment is up to the guild.

Applying for Membership
   In order to be allowed into a guild the player must first apply himself
as an applicant. You can do this by using the 'Society Apply <member>'
command where <member> is the enrolling member of the guild you wish to
join.

c) Who to talk to -
   
   In order to start a guild you must get your guild approved by the
appropriate god. At this time requests can be made to Rylar. Any guildhall
files etc can also be sent to Rylar at faerl@netcom.com.

	
Guildhalls
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

   Once your guild is approved it can then begin looking into having badges
made and a guildhall built. Guildhall's are not a requirement for beginning
a guild, they are available however for those guilds who wish to build them
(at a significant cost). Their location depends greatly on the guild's
desire for placement as well as realism (i.e. A rogues guild would probably
not want their guildhall out in the middle of a mountain range, while 
followers of the forest probably wouldn't want their guild in the sewers of
a large city). See 'Help Guildhall' for more information on how to make 
them and the cost to do so.

How to build a guildhall
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   
   
   The design and planning of a guildhall is completely the responsibility 
of the guild members. In order to make one, the guildhall must be designed
using the Duris docs (type 'help area' to get more information on the 
this) and the guildhall must be approved by the appropriate god. As well as 
purchasing the basic guildhall, guilds may pay extra for specific types of 
rooms, as well as guardians for their guilds. The guardians for these guilds 
will be different types of golems, there will be no dragons, unicorns etc. 
protecting your guildhall's. 

a) The Initial Cost -
    
    1) For a Basic Guildhall - 5k Plat
	 -This includes 5 rooms (Outside area, Entry room, meeting room, and
	  two optional rooms, as well as a guild bulletin board.)
    
    2) For a Basic Ship Guildhall - 10k Plat
	 -This is a ship of medium speed including 5 rooms and 500 hull 
	  points, as well as a guild bulletin board.
    
    3) For each extra rooms - 1k Plat
	
	 
b) The following items/flags may be added to rooms for the following 
   additional charges.      
       
      - Fountain - 500 Plat
      - Holy/Unholy Fountain - 3k Plat
      - Shops - 2k Plat
	  -They can be anything from a basic supply shop to a magical shop,
	   the items they carry are the same or similiar to basic items
	   around duris and vary depending on the guild and location.
	  -These shops may also include guild badges if desired. (Guild
	   badges cost 15 Plat for materials).
      - Healing - 2k Plat
	  -These rooms will speed up the healing process of guild members.
      - Protection spells - 500 Plat
	  -Basic Nosummon/No Dimension Door flags to protect the guildhall 
	   from assaults.
      - Inn - 1k Plat
      - Stables -1k Plat

* What can be done with guildhalls varies greatly upon location and the 
guild itself. A guildhall must consist of at least 10 rooms before a second
hall can be built anywhere else in the realms. If there is something desired
that is not listed please ask. This is only a basic outline of what's 
possible. 
       
Guardians    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

   There are three ways to protect a guild from non guild members. Guardians 
basically keep all non guild members out of the guildhall. Most will check
to see if a player trying to enter the guildhall wears a specific item
(guild badges). The better ones will actually recognize guild members on
sight. They are not however invincible and can be killed just like any other
creature of Duris. Glyphs of Warding will not allow any players to enter the
guild unless the player has the identifying mark of the guild (badge) and 
are more reliable than guardians. Also the main door into the guildhall can 
be made lockable and a key to the guild made. These doors are still pickable
however. The cost for these are as follows -

      - Flesh Golem - 1k Plat
      - Clay Golem - 2k Plat
      - Stone Golem - 3k Plat
      - Iron Golem - 4k Plat
	- Iron Golems will recognize guild members on sight and won't be
	  fooled by stolen guild badges.
      - Glyph of Warding - 5k Plat
      - Keys - 1 Plat 

*Note : The stats of the guardians will NOT be given out.

How to build a Guildhall
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

a) To build a guildhall you must do the following -

    1) Submit a file showing the following information.
       
       a) The cost of the guildhall with a break down of what each part of
	  the guildhall will cost and the total amount. This should include
	  Number of rooms, golems, special flags, etc.
       b) Descriptions for the rooms of the guildhall. Including what you
	  see when you 'look' into the next room as well as any colors used.
       c) Descriptions for any innkeepers, shopkeepers, and/or golems in the
	  guildhall (if you're using any).
       d) Descriptions for any keys/boards if desired.
       e) The location of where any objects/mobs in the guildhall should be
	  placed.
    
    2) Decide on a location for the guildhall. It is up to the guild to 
       determine where they would like the guildhall built. Once decided upon
       the location must be approved by the god responcible for guilds at
       the time. (See 'Who to talk to' under help guilds).

    3) And of course pay for the guild. The money needed to build the
       must be paid from the guild bank account once the plans for the 
       guildhall are approved. At this time the guildhall will be then be
       started. Note that there is no guarantee that your guildhall will be
       put onto the guild the next day. Checking the file and getting it
       placed on Duris requires that other zone exits and such be altered
       as well so it can take some time.

	
How to get Badges
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  In order to have badges made you must an active guildhall. Once put onto
the mud they will then be purchasable through a guild shop or mob. To have
them created you must submit a file showing the description for the badge 
desired. The description should include -
       
	a) What the badge looks like when worn.
	b) What the badge looks like when looked at.
	c) What colors should be used for each description of the badge.
	d) The keywords used to get/hold/wear the badge. 
	  (Note: The word 'badge' will be used for ALL badges however you 
	   can use other keywords as well if desired.)
