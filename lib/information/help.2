SOCIETY EXAMPLES
----------------

Becoming a founding leader:

1) soc secede - to secede from the association one is joined up in,
2) soc apply me - to clear applications to other associations,
3) decide on the association name and whether challenge will be allowed,
4) talk to association god(s).

Note that 1) and 2) can be skipped if one isn't member/applicant.


Typical enrolment procedure (Aguy is non-member, Bguy is senior member):

Aguy: ' I would like to join.
Bguy: ' Ok, entrance fee is 10 plat.
Bguy: society   *To check how much money the association has now.*
Aguy: society apply Bguy   *Aguy is now applicant to Bguy's association.*
Aguy: society deposit 10 plat   *Aguy pays entrance fee.*
Aguy: ' Ok, I paid up.
Bguy: society   *To check that statement*.
Bguy: society enrol Aguy   *Enrol Aguy to the association as normal member.*

Note that Aguy pays to the association, not to Bguy, to avoid fraud.


Officer Aguy wants to issue a general membership fee of 1 plat, fine Bguy
10 plat and keep Cguy completely free of debt (Cguy has no debt up to now):

Aguy: society fine all 1 p   *Fines only members with lower rank!*
Aguy: society fine Bguy 10 p   *Bguy now has at least a debt of 11 plat.* 
Aguy: society fine Cguy -20 p   *Subtracts 20 p from Cguy's debt, wiping it.* 


Leader Bigone and Deputy Notsobig disagree on treating Member Twink:

Bigone: society punish Twink   *Puts Twink on parole*
Notsobig: society rank Twink +1   *Twink is normal member again.* 
Bigone: tell Notsobig WTF?
Bigone: society punish Twink   *He is on parole again.*
Bigone: society punish Twink   *Now he is enemy, Notsobig can't lift that.*
Bigone: society fine Notsobig 100 plat   *Notsobig is in trouble...*
Notsobig: ' You are going down!   *Notsobig is in same room as Bigone.*
Notsobig: society challenge Bigone   *Say he wins the challenge.*
Notsobig: society kickout Bigone   *Notsobig is the leader now: Bye, bye...*
Notsobig: society rank Twink +5   *He makes Twink Deputy.*
Bigone: ' Hah!
Bigone: kill Notsobig    *Say he wins and Notsobig looses lots of Exp.*
Twink: society challenge Notsobig   *Twink exploits that to become leader.*
Twink: society rank Notsobig -3   *He really is an a... .*
Twink: ' Bigone, 20 plat to me and you are back in.   *Etc.*
