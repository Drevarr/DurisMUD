How to build a guildhall
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   
   
   The design and planning of a guildhall is completely the responsibility 
of the guild members. In order to make one, the guildhall must be designed
using the Duris docs (type 'help area' to get more information on the 
this) and the guildhall must be approved by the appropriate god. As well as 
purchasing the basic guildhall, guilds may pay extra for specific types of 
rooms, as well as guardians for their guilds. The guardians for these guilds 
will be different types of golems, there will be no dragons, unicorns etc. 
protecting your guildhall's.

	   the items they carry are the same or similiar to basic items
	   around duris and vary depending on the guild and location.

* The cost of some items or rooms may vary depending on the location. What
can be done with guildhalls varies greatly upon location and the guild
itself. A guildhall must consist of at least 10 rooms before a second
hall can be built anywhere else in the realms. If there is something desired
that is not listed please ask. This is only a basic outline of what's 
possible. 
       
Guardians    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

   There are three ways to protect a guild from non guild members. Guardians 
basically keep all non guild members out of the guildhall. Most will check
to see if a player trying to enter the guildhall wears a specific item
(guild badges). The better ones will actually recognize guild members on
sight. They are not however invincible and can be killed just like any other
creature of Duris. Glyphs of Warding will not allow any players to enter the
guild unless the player has the identifying mark of the guild (badge) and 
are more reliable than guardians. Also the main door into the guildhall can 
be made lockable and a key to the guild made. These doors are still pickable
however. The cost for these are as follows -

      - Flesh Golem - 1k Plat
      - Clay Golem - 2k Plat
      - Stone Golem - 3k Plat
      - Iron Golem - 4k Plat
	- Iron Golems will recognize guild members on sight and won't be
	  fooled by stolen guild badges.
      - Glyph of Warding - 5k Plat
      - Keys - 1 Plat 

*Note : The stats of the guardians will NOT be given out.

How to build a Guildhall
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

a) To build a guildhall you must do the following -

    1) Submit a file showing the following information.
       
       a) The cost of the guildhall with a break down of what each part of
	  the guildhall will cost and the total amount. This should include
	  Number of rooms, golems, special flags, etc.
       b) Descriptions for the rooms of the guildhall. Including what you
	  see when you 'look' into the next room as well as any colors used.
       c) Descriptions for any innkeepers, shopkeepers, and/or golems in the
	  guildhall (if you're using any).
       d) Descriptions for any keys/boards if desired.
       e) The location of where any objects/mobs in the guildhall should be
	  placed.
    
    2) Decide on a location for the guildhall. It is up to the guild to 
       determine where they would like the guildhall built. Once decided upon
       the location must be approved by the god responcible for guilds at
       the time. (See 'Who to talk to').

    3) And of course pay for the guild. The money needed to build the
       must be paid from the guild bank account once the plans for the 
       guildhall are approved. At this time the guildhall will be then be
       started. Note that there is no guarantee that your guildhall will be
       put onto the guild the next day. Checking the file and getting it
       placed on Duris requires that other zone exits and such be altered
       as well so it can take some time.

	
How to get Badges

  In order to have badges made you must an active guildhall. Once put onto
the mud they will then be purchasable through a guild shop or mob. To have

	a) What the badge looks like when worn.
	b) What the badge looks like when looked at.
	c) What colors should be used for each description of the badge.
	d) The keywords used to get/hold/wear the badge. 
	  (Note: The word 'badge' will be used for ALL badges however you 
	   can use other keywords as well if desired.)
