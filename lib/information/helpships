SHIP1

  The ship system works on a priciple of speed and heading.  What this means
is that if you set your ship to a certain speed, it will continue moving
until the speed is set to 0.  Heading is the direction that the ship is
pointing and hence will be the direction the ship will be travelling. 
Heading is done from a 0-360 degree circle with north being 0, east being
90, south being 180, and west being 270.

  Also  affecting the ships is acceleration and turn rate.  When a speed is 
set, theship does not immediately jump to that speed, it has to accelerate to 
the set speed.  Acceleration is faster on smaller ships with large sails than 
a large ship with small sails.  On the same note, when a heading is set, the
ship does not immediatly face that direction, it has to turn to that
direction, this is the turn rate.  Turn rate is higher on smaller ships than
large Dreadnaughts, so theoretically a small fast Clipper can run circles
around a Galleon.  Turn rate is also affected by the speed of the ship, the
faster a ship is traveling the slower they turn, and below a minimum speed,
the ship also turns slower so it is best to maintain a medium speed for best
maneuverability.

SHIP2

  Combat on the ship system works on the priciple of firing arcs, range,
targets, and damage.  You might be asking what are firing arcs, but it's 
simple, firing arcs are the direction your weapons are pointing on your ship.  
For example, a ballistae mounted on your Port(Left) side is pointing to the 
ship's left, so if the target is on the right side, it is out of that particular weapon's
arc.  The fore and rear arcs are both 45 degree arcs and the port(left) and
starboard(right) are 120 degree arcs, so if weapons are mounted only on
the forward arc, that means the ship only has a cone of fire 45 degrees in
the front.  If a ship has weapons on all four parts of the ship it can
basically shoot in any direction.

  Each weapon has a Short, Medium, and Long range to them.  What this means
is that a Large Ballistae which might have a Short range of 5, Medium of 10,
and long of 15 can shoot targets as far as 15 squares away, as the ship gets
closer to the targat and gets within 10 squares, the ship will have a better
chance of hitting the target, if the gargets gets within 5 squares, it will
be an almost sure hit.

  When fighting on the oceans a target must be set for your weapons where
the crew will try to keep them in the weapon's sight.  A Ship can only be
locked on to one target at a time, but can retarget to another ship at any
time.

  And last, we come to the wonderful world of DAMAGE, where duris shines in
all its glory.  When a ship is hit, it is hit on one of the four sides of a
ship.  Each side of a ship has two types of HP, one is the armor.  Armor is
made to take damage, as long as a ship has armor, its weapons and insides
are protected, once the ship's armor is blasted away however, damage goes to
the internal structure of the ship.  Internal structure is basically the
framework of the ship, hits in the internal structure can cause critical
hits where it knocks the crew to the ground or even destroys weapons.  Once
all the internals of a side are gone, the ship is taking on water, but not
enough to sink it, but enough to immobilize it.  Once two internal structure
sides are blown away, the ship no longer can float and will sink.  If the
ship is fast enough and doesn't want to get blown up, they have the choice
of running, but be warned, the rear of a ship has about half the armor and
has more delicate structure than the rest of the ship (Like the Rudder) so
the ship will be quite vulnerable there.  Also when a ship gets hit, it has
a chance of getting hit in the sails which makes the ship not able to move
as fast (can't move if your sails have big holes in it), and even possibly,
with enough hits get completely destroyed, making the ship dead in the
water.

One more thing, when a weapon is fired it will take approx 30 seconds to
reload.

SHIP3

  Ok so you've got the money to spend, now it's time to talk about money
sink known as the ship shops.  Here you will find people who will build you
a better, bigger, stronger, faster ship. They have the parts, they have the 
technology, they have the power.  The first think to do if you do not already 
own a ship, is to buy a hull.  Hulls are the basic foundation of a ship, it's 
where you will mount your one peashooter small ballistae on your sloop, it's 
where you will place a sail on the ship, and it's where you'll have great fun 
becoming a full fledged pirate.  To say the least, the larger the hull, the more
things you can put on it, but one thing to be warned of is, the larger the
hull, the larger the sail you will need to make the darned thing move an
inch...  and you know what that means boys and girls.. MONEY!  Be prepared
to spend your life savings of allowances here for it will cost you an arm
and a leg to get a Dreadnaught with decent sails and enough firepower to
wipe out Tharnadia without breaking a sweat, and then some.  After you have
bought your hull, you MUST equip it with a sail at the very minimum,
otherwise it won't move. (I'm sorry but paddling a Galleon with your hands
isn't gonna work) After you buy the sails, now you can buy weapons if you
have room left.  Take careful consideration where you place weapons.  If you
place them all in the front, all your other sides will be vulnerable to
attack.  It's best to configure your ship the way you sail, if you're a
frontal attack person, then by all means mount them there, if you're a
sneaky person and mount all your weapons in the back so that fool who's
headed on a collision course runs past you leaving their rear exposed will
get their ass kicked (literally), then that's up to you as well.  Once you
own a ship and decide that your ship isn't big enough, you can opt to
upgrade the ship (kinda like a remodel).  Upgrading your hull will cost you,
but not the full cost of a new hull, so you won't lose your entire
investment.  Also, existing weapons won't be lost either.

	List of all on Ship commands
-------==============================--------

Orders - syntax 'Order <subcommand> parameters'
=======---------------------
speed <number>
  - This will set your speed to a specific speed.  (your ship must
    (d)accelerate to the set speed though)

heading <number or N/E/S/W>
  - This will change your direction to the specified heading.
    
    Headings:
    North = 0
    East  = 90
    South = 180
    West  = 270

    Note: Remember kids, your ships don't turn instantly, so don't cry bug
          if the ship crashes while you are running aground and type a
          heading change at the lase second.

maneuver <N/E/S/W>
  - This will maneuver your ship into and out of docks.  Since you can't use
    your sails inside a dock, you maneuver with paddles, ropes, slaves,
    whatever.  What this means is to move out to the open ocean (map), you
    must maneuver until you are on the map, and then you can use speed and
    heading from there.  Conversly, you also use the maneuver command to
    dock, since using sails will make you crash.  To dock, move your ship
    next to a dockable place then 'order maneuver <direction of dockable
    place>' and your ship will dock.  You must be at speed 10 or below to
    maneuver.

undock 
  - If your ship is docked, your crew must undock the ship before it can
    sail.  Your first officer will go through a checklist and when he's 
    done you can maneuver or sail away.

SHIP5

Misc commands - syntax is just typing the command with any parameters.
==============----------------------------
look <status/ship>
  - This will show you a detailed status of your ship with HPs and weapon
    status (whether its reloading or ready to fire) and ammo remaining.  It
    will also show your position, speed, heading and target(if any)

look weaponspec
  - This will show you the specifications of all your weapons.  It will show
    their weapn ranges and damage each shot will do as well as if the weapon is
    destroyed or not.

look sight <weapon number>
  - If your have a target this command will show you your percentage to hit
    the target with that particular weapon.

look tactical (optional parameters are <X> <Y>)
  - This will show you a tactical map centered on you.  It is displayed as a
    hex grid and any nearby ships will be displayed according to their ID. 
    If the optional parameters <X> and <Y> are given the map will center on
    that coord if it is within 35 hexes.

Combat Commands - syntax is just typing the command with any parameters
================------------------------------
look contacts
  - This will display a list of all ships within a 35 square radius of your
    ship.  This is the heart of getting info on your target.The list is broken 
    into several parts and will look kinda like this:

    Contact listing
    ===============================================
    [AN] 'NorgDog'         X:53  Y:50  Z:0   R:3.0   B:90  H:0   S:0 |S

    AN is the ship's ID this is the parameter you pass to lock to lock onto
    this target.

    'Norgdog' is the ship's name.

    X:53 and Y:50 are their x, y coords on your tactical map, so if you do a
    'look tactical 53 50', it will center the map on Norgdog.

    R:3.0 is Range, so in this case, Norgdog is 3 Squares from you.

    B:90 is their bearing to you, so in this case, Norgdog is to your east 
    since 90 is east, so if you were to head east, you would be facing
    Norgdog.

    H:0 is Norgdog's heading.. so in this case, Norgdog is facing north
    since 0 is North.

    S:0 is Norgdog's speed so in this case, its not moving since it's 0.

    Last but not least is the S, which means it is on your starboard firing
    arc so if you have any weapons on your starboard side, they can fire at
    Norgdog.

lock <ID>
  - This will set your target to the ID, so in the above contact example, if
    you typed 'lock AN', it would lock onto Norgdog.

fire <weapon number>
  - This is the happy time command.  This will fire the weapon at the
    specified target, only if the target is within range, and in the
    weapon's firing arc.
