Player Guilds
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

   This document is designed to answer any questions regarding the creation
of player guilds on Duris. Under the new guild system players are 
responsible for the organization of their own guilds. Although guilds may 
worship whatever god (although they don't have to worship any) they choose,
the gods themselves will not be responsible or serve any function in the 
running of a guild. Guilds will also be allowed to build guildhall's in 
Duris, although again this is not required to form a guild.

How To Begin A Guild
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

a) The requirements for beginning an guild on Duris are as follows -
							
    1. The guild must have at least 6 active players starting the guild.
    2. Each of these members must be at least 25th level or above.
    3. The guild must submit a charter specifying the guilds name, purpose
       and/or goal to the appropriate god and that charter must be approved.
    4. After the inital 6 members have started the guild, it is up to the
       guild charter to decide what, if any level restrictions are required 
       to join the guild.
     
b) What this allows -
   
   Once a guild has been started and approved by Duris the guild members
of that guild must run their own activities. The gods themselves will have no 
interference with the running of the guild themselves unless the guild's 
activities break one of Duris's other rules. The members will be able to 
get guild titles as well as badges (no stats, no armor class etc.). There 
will be no 'special' guild items which give members extra stats or powers.
 
c) GuildHalls -
   
   Guildhall's are not a requirement for beginning a guild, they are 
available however for those guilds who wish to build them (at a significant 
cost). Their location depends greatly on the guild's desire for placement as 
well as realism (i.e. A rogues guild would probably not want their guildhall 
out in the middle of a mountain range, while followers of Mielikki probably 
wouldn't want their guild in the sewers of a large city). The cost for these 
guildhall's are included later in this document.

d) Who to talk to -
   
   In order to start a guild you must get your charter and guild approved by
the appropriate god. At this time requests can be made to Helm or mailed to
faerl@netcom.com with the following information -
	
	1. Guild name.
	2. Members making the request.
	3. Copy of the charter.


How to build a guildhall
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   
   
   The design and planning of a guildhall is completely the responsibility 
of the guild members. In order to make one, the guildhall must be designed
using the Duris docs (type 'help area' to get more information on the 
this) and the guildhall must be approved by the appropriate god. As well as 
purchasing the basic guildhall, guilds may pay extra for specific types of 
rooms, as well as guardians for their guilds. The guardians for these guilds 
will be different types of golems, there will be no dragons, unicorns etc. 
protecting your guildhall's. Also the guild members may have their hometown
set to a room in the guildhall, so that they return there upon death.

a) The Initial Cost -
    
    1) For a Basic Guildhall - 50k Plat
	 -This includes 4 rooms (Outside area, Entry room, meeting room, and
	  one optional room, as well as a guild bulletin board.)
    
    2) For a Basic Ship Guildhall - 100k Plat
	 -This is a ship of medium speed including 5 rooms and 500 hull 
	  points, as well as a guild bulletin board.
    
    3) For each extra rooms - 20k Plat
	 -These rooms have just basic flags (light etc.) if you wish for
	  special flags, the following ones are available and may be added to 
	  these rooms when built or added onto them at a later date.
     
b) The following items/flags ma2 be added to rooms for the following 
   additional charges.      
	
      - Fountain - 5k Plat
      - Holy/Unholy Fountain - 30k Plat
      - Slot Machine - 10k Plat
      - Shop - 20k Plat
	   -A basic shop, carrying ordinary items such as torches, backpacks,
	    rations, etc.
	   -These shops may also include guild badges if desired. (at a cost 
	    of 5 Plat for materials).
      - Healing - 10k Plat
	   - These rooms will speed up the healing process of guild members.
      - Protection spells - 5k Plat
	   -Basic Nosummon/No Dimension Door flags to protect the guildhall 
	    from future assaults during race wars. This price includes the
	    casting of both these spells.
      - Inn - 5k Plat
	
Guardians    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
   There are two ways to protect a guild from non guild members. Guardians 
basically keep all non guild members out of the guildhall, they will not 
allow players to enter the guildhall unless they are wearing a specific item
(badges) or tell the guardian a specific phrase. They are not however 
invincible and can be killed just like any other creature of Duris. Glyphs
of Warding will check players for the identifying mark of the guild (badge), 
those who then attempt to enter the guildhall without the proper badge will 
be shocked for a good amount of their damage and movement points. 

The cost for these are as follows -

       - Flesh Golem - 10k Plat
       - Clay Golem - 20k Plat
       - Stone Golem - 30k Plat
       - Iron Golem - 40k Plat
       - Glyph of Warding - 50k Plat

*Note : The stats of the guardians will NOT be given out.
