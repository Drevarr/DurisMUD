As you have indicated you are new to Duris, you have been assigned a newbie flag that will be visible to everyone on the player list.  You will notice when you log in that other players may also have &+GNewbie&n flags, and some will have &+GGuide&N flags.  There will likely be Immortals available to help you as well.  Please feel free to message any of these people privately (using 'tell <username> <message>') or through the global channel (using 'nchat <message>').

You will be prompted soon to choose a race for your new character.  If you choose to roll an evil character, you will spawn in the evil hometown for your race.  Be aware that this is &+RWILL NOT BE EASY&n, as our evil racewar is meant to challenge even the most adept players.  We recommend only playing an evil character if you have previous experience with Duris and are willing to accept that &+Bchallenge&n.

If you choose a good racewar player, which we strongly recommend, you will have the option to spawn in a Newbie zone called &+LAilvio&n, where you will learn about some of the common commands, run a few small quests and spend some time gaining levels in safety before porting out into your hometown.  Having Newbie EQ toggled on, you will spawn a new set of starter gear after each death, regardless of which racewar you play.  Note: You will be able to swap attributes (strength and agility for instance) after you finish rolling them and adding four bonus rolls, so don't be upset if you play a warrior and you get an excellent in wisdom.

Press Return and choose your race with care...
